  "description" : "Asset Encumbrance is a dataset which contains Information on the level of asset encumbrance in institutions needed by supervisory authorities. The dataset allows a harmonised measure of asset encumbrance across institutions, which allows  supervisory authorities to compare the reliance on secured funding and the degree of structural subordination of unsecured creditors and depositors across institutions. It also allows supervisors  to assess the ability of institutions to handle funding stress, by providing an assessment of the ability of switching to secured funding. It can be also be incorporated into crisis management, as it  allows for a broad assessment of the amounts of assets available in a resolution situation.",
