  "description" : "Scheme defining the interest rates during the life of the exposure which only includes constant rates - numeric constant rate known with certainty at the inception of the exposure - and where the interest rates apply to the whole exposure. The scheme may contain more than one constant interest rate to be applied at different periods during the life of the exposure (e.g. loan with a constant interest rate during the initial fixed-rate period, which then changes to a different interest rate, which is still constant, and which was known at the inception of the exposure)."
