  "description" : "Credit granted either via delayed debit cards, or via credit cards. Extended credit is defined as the credit granted after the due dates of the previous billing cycles have passed, i.e. debit amounts on the card account that have not been settled when this was first possible, for which an interest rate or tiered interest rates usually greater than 0 % are charged. Often minimum instalments per month have to be made, to at least partially repay extended credit."
