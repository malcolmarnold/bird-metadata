  "description" : "The captive financial institutions and money lenders subsector (S.127) consists of all financial corporations and quasi-corporations which are neither engaged in financial intermediation nor in providing financial auxiliary services, and where most of either their assets or their liabilities are not transacted on open markets. This category includes units as legal entities such as trusts, estates, agencies accounts or ‘brass plate’ companies; SPEs that qualify as institutional units and raise funds in open markets to be used by their parent corporation; units which provide financial services exclusively with own funds, or funds provided by a sponsor, to a range of clients and incur the financial risk of the debtor defaulting; special purpose government funds, usually called sovereign wealth funds, if classified as financial corporations."
