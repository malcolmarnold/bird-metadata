  "description" : "A Financial asset instrument is an Instrument role where the Instrument acts in the role of a Financial asset (according to the applied accounting standard) where the instrument is intended as an asset, either for the reporting agent or for someone else. \nPlease note that a Financial asset instrument does not necessarily be recognised in the balance sheet.\nPlease note too that an instrument can be both an Asset and a Liability at the same time. This can happen, for example, when a debtor overpays the fees and/or installments.",
