  "description" : "(1)\t\nDelta CSR non-securitisation: the CSR non-securitisation delta risk factors are defined along two dimensions:\n\n(a)\t\nthe relevant issuer credit spread curves (bond and CDS); and\n\n(b)\t\nthe following tenors: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.\n\n(2)\t\nVega CSR non-securitisation: the vega risk factors are the implied volatilities of options that reference the relevant credit issuer names as underlyings (bond and CDS); further defined along one dimension - the maturity of the option. This is defined as the implied volatility of the option as mapped to one or several of the following maturity tenors: 0.5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.\n\n(3)\t\nCurvature CSR non-securitisation: the CSR non-securitisation curvature risk factors are defined along one dimension: the relevant issuer credit spread curves (bond and CDS). For instance, the bond-inferred spread curve of an issuer and the CDS-inferred spread curve of that same issuer should be considered a single spread curve. For the calculation of sensitivities, all tenors (as defined for CSR) are to be shifted in parallel.\n\n----\nNote on modelling. The risk this risk factor relates to can also be a derivative of an issue of the issuer. So the issuer is the is the issuer of the debt security and not of the derivative of that debt security.",
