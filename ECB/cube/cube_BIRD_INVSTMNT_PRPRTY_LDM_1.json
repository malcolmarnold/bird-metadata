  "description" : "Investment property is property (land or a building—or part of a building— or both) held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for:\n(a) use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes; or\n(b) sale in the ordinary course of business.\nAs defined by IAS 40.5\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-property.asp:\nAn investment property is real estate property purchased with the intention of earning a return on the investment either through rental income, the future resale of the property, or both. The property may be held by an individual investor, a group of investors, or a corporation.\nAn investment property can be a long-term endeavor or a short-term investment. With the latter, investors will often engage in flipping, where real estate is bought, remodeled or renovated, and sold at a profit within a short time frame.\nThe term investment property may also be used to describe other assets an investor purchases for the sake of future appreciation such as art, securities, land, or other collectibles.",
