  "description" : "An Asset backed security (ABS) is a Debt security with underlying assets where, in the event of failure (of payment) of the issuer, the underlying assets are not used on a priority basis for the reimbursement of the Asset backed security (ABS).\nAn asset-backed security (ABS) is a type of financial investment that is collateralized by an underlying pool of assets—usually ones that generate a cash flow from debt, such as loans, leases, credit card balances, or receivables. It takes the form of a bond or note, paying income at a fixed rate for a set amount of time, until maturity. For income-oriented investors, asset-backed securities can be an alternative to other debt instruments, like corporate bonds or bond funds.",
