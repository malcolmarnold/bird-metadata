  "description" : "A Framework subdomain is the combination of a Framework and a Subdomain. It establishes the many-to-many relationship between Frameworks and Subdomains.\nThe justification of this relationship (between Frameworks and Subdomains) is that Subdomains may not only be used directly in the Framework (e.g. in a Cube structure item associated to the Framework) but also indirectly (e.g. a Subdomain that is used in the Transformations between Frameworks).",
