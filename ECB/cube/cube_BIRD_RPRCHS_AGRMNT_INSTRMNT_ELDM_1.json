  "description" : "A Repurchase agreement instrument is a Securities financial transaction (SFT) fulfilling the definition of Annex V, part 2.183-184:\n183. ‘Repurchase agreements’ (‘repos’) shall be transactions in which the institution receives cash in exchange for financial assets sold at a given price under a commitment to repurchase the same (or identical) assets at a fixed price on a specified future date. Transactions involving the temporary transfer of gold against cash collateral shall also be considered ‘Repurchase agreements’ (‘repos’). Amounts received by the institution in exchange for financial assets transferred to a third party (‘temporary acquirer’) shall be classified under ‘repurchase agreements’ where there is a commitment to reverse the operation and not merely an option to do so. Repurchase agreements shall also include repo-type operations which may include: \n\t(a) Amounts received in exchange for securities temporarily transferred to a third party in the form of securities lending against cash collateral; \n\t(b) Amounts received in exchange for securities temporarily transferred to a third party in the form of sale/buy-back agreement. \n184. ‘Repurchase agreements’ (‘repos’) and ‘reverse repurchase loans’ (‘reverse repos’) shall involve cash received or loaned out by the institution.",
