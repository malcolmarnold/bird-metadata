  "description" : "A Deposit is a Loan (excluding Reverse repurchase agreement) fulfilling the definition of Regulation (EU) 549/2013, 5.79 (amended, see remark):\nDefinition: deposits are standardised, non-negotiable contracts with the public at large and allowing the placement and the later withdrawal of the principal amount by the creditor. Deposits usually involve the debtor giving back the full principal amount to the investor.\n\nRemark: the original definition includes \"offered by deposit-taking corporations and, in some cases, by central government as debtors\" which was removed because of the dependency on the involved Party.",
