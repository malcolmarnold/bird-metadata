  "description" : "Subscription rights that are traded separately are often given their own separate International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). They are classified as shares, rather than as financial derivatives, since they represent a claim on the residual value of a corporation. Issuers of shares use subscription rights to provide existing shareholders with the opportunity to participate in new issues, which enables them to retain their proportional share in the ownership of the corporation. To make the new shares even more attractive, these subscription rights may also allow existing shareholders to buy the shares at less than the market price."
