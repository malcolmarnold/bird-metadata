  "description" : "Participation certificates grant their holders participation rights. Participation rights may take various forms, both for equity securities and for debt securities. In many countries, almost no legal restrictions are placed on this type of financial instrument. Depending on their specific features, participation certificates are considered to be either equity securities or debt securities. They are treated as equity securities if the following criteria are met: a) the holder’s claims are subordinated, b)the holder’s remuneration is performance related and c) capital is provided for an unlimited period, or at least on a long-term basis. In light of these criteria, most participation certificates are considered to be equity securities. 3.47 “Genussscheine” (or “Genussrechte”) are a type of participation certificate. These are issued mainly in European countries such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. “Genussscheine” sometimes have a stated maturity."
