  "description" : "Stapled instruments - which, under their terms of issue, are two or more different financial instruments (for example, ordinary equity securities and unsecured notes) coupled together for certain purposes - are usually treated separately as fixed interest rate debt securities and equity securities. However, stapled instruments usually cannot be transferred separately either in the market or as the result of an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction. A parcel consisting of one equity security and one or more notes is traded in the market as though it were a single security, although conceptually the components are regarded as separate. If the components cannot be separately identified, the stapled instrument should be classified according to the predominant component, that is, either as a debt security or an equity security."
