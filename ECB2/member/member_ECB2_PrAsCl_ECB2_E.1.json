  "description" : "Ordinary shares (or “common” shares) usually give holders the right to the following:\n• Holders are generally entitled to participate in the corporation’s general policymaking and have the right to attend, speak, and vote (in the case of voting shares) at general meetings. Holders of ordinary shares can vote on corporate objectives and matters of policy, on stock splits, and to elect the corporation’s board of directors.\n• Holders are usually entitled to a preferential subscription in the event of a capital increase. Some holders of ordinary shares also receive preemptive rights (a rights issue), which enables them to retain their proportional share in the ownership\nof a corporation should it issue more stock.\n• Holders generally have the right to a share in the corporation’s profits. However, no fixed dividends are paid out to ordinary shareholders. Ordinary shareholders’ returns are therefore uncertain and dependent on earnings, corporate reinvestment, and the market’s ability to value and sell stock efficiently."
