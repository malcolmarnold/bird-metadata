  "description" : "These can be redeemed at the request of either the corporation or the shareholder (at a fixed price on a specified date or during a specified period of time). Strict conditions apply to the issuance of redeemable shares and their redemption. Instead of cancelling shares on redemption, a corporation may continue to hold such shares as treasury shares, but no voting rights may be exercised and no dividends are payable."
