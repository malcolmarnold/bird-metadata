  "description" : "In case of unguaranteed securities, there are no obligations to guarantors to make payments to the holder of the security if the issuer fails to meet the obligation to make repayments arising under the instrument secured by the guarantor. Subordinated securities have a lower priority than the issuer’s other securities in the event of liquidation. A further differentiation can be made between Junior and Senior level with the Senior level having a higher priority. Securities are backed by assets, future income streams or similar."
